# 👋 Hi there

## ⭐ About me
🎓 I'm Hector, a 20-year-old aspiring self-taught Software Engineer (Specializing in Backend Development) currently working in a restaurant, studying 2+ hours everyday looking to build more quality projects and just be a little better everyday.

👨‍💻 I enjoy creating and building reliable software and I'm very enthusiastic about learning how new technologies work and how I can utilize them, currently I know **Flask**, **REST**, **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQL**, **Git & Github**, experienced with **Linux**, **Unix**, and **Windows**. White hat hacker, reporting various vulnerabilities to smaller businesses from security misconfigurations from default credentials, subdomain admin panel exposure all the way to XSS and Race Conditions, preventing critical security holes from threat adversaries. I'm also very enthusiastic in talking or learning with/from like-minded people!

🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not working or studying, I love pushing my limits in powerlifting, currently my total is 1300lbs and I'm on a journey to a 1600lb total, currently on a weight loss journey from 250lbs to 215lbs. getting stronger bit by bit everyday.

🤔 I'm looking for feedback on my code or any projects I may commit, I would love if anyone can help me improve regardless of whatever it may be. Or even shoot me a message and we can talk!

⚡ Fun fact: Flamingos can fly up to 14,000 feet in the air with flights going as long as 300 miles at a time!
